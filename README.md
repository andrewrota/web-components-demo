# Web Components Demo

Experimenting with some of the features of web components, shadow DOM, etc. 
## Resources

Most of the examples in the demos are not mine; I'm building them based on the examples and code in the following excellent resources:

* [Eric Bidelman's <web>components</web>](http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/webcomponents/index.html)
* [Peter Gasston's Web Components: Getting Started](https://speakerdeck.com/stopsatgreen/web-components-getting-started)
